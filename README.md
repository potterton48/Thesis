# Thesis
These code files were used to produce results in the thesis "Computational methods that predict residence times of GPCR ligands" by Andrew Potterton.

Most of the code files will not work if they are run on other machines, they were specifically developed for the file setup/databases on my machine. The main purpose of sharing the code is for being open how the data was produced. However, one may adapt any parts of the code for use in one's own project.


All code has a MIT licence.
